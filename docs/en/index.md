# Welcome to EPIPHANY's Homepage

This website is only for learning, exchange and discussion. 

This website is a note-taking platform built by Epiphany, aiming to optimize the note-taking process through computer technology and eliminate the waste of time and energy caused by paper notes. Although paper notes are more readable and have more stable storage media, in the context of each person having a notebook, taking notes during class and reviewing them after class through a website is probably more rapid and convenient. 

This website is mainly for personal use and is not available for others at present.
